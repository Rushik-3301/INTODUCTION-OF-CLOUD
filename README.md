      DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION
* DISTRIBUTED APPLUCATION ARE SOFTWARE THAT RUNS ON MULTIPLE COMPUTERS WITHIN A NETWORK AT THE SAMETIME AND CAN BE STORED ON A SERVER.
* DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION ALLOW MULTIPLE USERS TO ACCESS THE APP AT ONCE.
* ( DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY) DLT INCLUDES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.
* DLG IS BASED ON A NETWORK OF COMPUTERS CALLED NODES.
* MANY CLOUD PROVIDERS ALREADY OFFER DLT AND BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES.
* CLOUD IS IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MANAGING DLT AND BLOCKCHAIN NODES.

     CLOUD COMPUTING WITH AI
* ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE IS A COMPUTING STARTEGY THAT PROCESS THE PROCESSING DATA FOR COMPUTER PROGRAMMES TO MAKE DECISIONS.
* AI SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY MAKE A GOOD DECISIONS,THE COMPUTER PROGRAMMES LEARN AND STORE AND MAKE CURRECT DECISIONS.
* CLOUD PROVIDE AND EXCELLENT ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRED FOR AI SUCH AS DATA STORAGE,RETRIEVAL AND PROCESSING.
* DIGITAL ASSISTANT LIKE SIRI,ALEXA AND GOOGLE HOME BLEND AI CLOUD COMPUTING IN OUR LIVES EVERYDAY.
* ALL AL PROCESSDATA AND MAKE CORRECT DECISIONS,THE COMPUTER LEARN AND STORE AND MAKE CURRECT DECISIONS.
