# THE FUTURE OF CLOUD COMPUTING

# TOPIC 
       SERVERLESS COMPUTING
* SERVERLESS COMPUTING IS AN EXTENSION OF A FUNCTION AS A SERVICE (FAAS).
* SERVERLESS COMPUTING IS A CLOUD COMPUTING EXECUTION MODEL WHERE THE CLOUD PROVIDER RUNS THE SERVER,AND DYNAMICALLY MANAGE THE ALOOCATION OF MACHINE RESOURCES.
* THE COMPUTING RESOURCES ARE DELIVERED IN A DYNAMIC FASHION.
* PROVIDES ADVANDAGES WITH RESPECT TO THE COST AND SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT.
* SERVERLESS COMPUTING IS EXECUTION ONLY, DATA IS NOT STORED WITH A SERVERLESS OFERING.
# TOPIC
      DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION
* DISTRIBUTED APPLUCATION ARE SOFTWARE THAT RUNS ON MULTIPLE COMPUTERS WITHIN A NETWORK AT THE SAMETIME AND CAN BE STORED ON A SERVER.
* DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION ALLOW MULTIPLE USERS TO ACCESS THE APP AT ONCE.
* ( DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY) DLT INCLUDES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.
* DLG IS BASED ON A NETWORK OF COMPUTERS CALLED NODES.
* MANY CLOUD PROVIDERS ALREADY OFFER DLT AND BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES.
* CLOUD IS IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MANAGING DLT AND BLOCKCHAIN NODES.

# TOPIC 
     CLOUD COMPUTING WITH AI
* ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE IS A COMPUTING STARTEGY THAT PROCESS THE PROCESSING DATA FOR COMPUTER PROGRAMMES TO MAKE DECISIONS.
* AI SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY MAKE A GOOD DECISIONS,THE COMPUTER PROGRAMMES LEARN AND STORE AND MAKE CURRECT DECISIONS.
* CLOUD PROVIDE AND EXCELLENT ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRED FOR AI SUCH AS DATA STORAGE,RETRIEVAL AND PROCESSING.
* DIGITAL ASSISTANT LIKE SIRI,ALEXA AND GOOGLE HOME BLEND AI CLOUD COMPUTING IN OUR LIVES EVERYDAY.
* ALL AL PROCESSDATA AND MAKE CORRECT DECISIONS,THE COMPUTER LEARN AND STORE AND MAKE CURRECT DECISIONS.
# TOPIC
     CLOUD COMPUTING WITH IOT
* THE INTERNET OF THINGS IS ASYSTEM OF CORRESPODING BILLIONS OF PHYSICAL DEVICES ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHICH ALL ARE PROVIDED BY UNIQUE IDENTITYS AND ALL ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET WITH SHARING AND COLLECTING DATA WITHOUT REQUIRING HUMAN TO HUMAN HUMAN TO COMPUTER INTERACTION.
* WITH THE GREATER USAGE OF IOT IN CLOUD AS ACETED AS AN IMPULSE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF SCALABLE IOT APPLICATION AND BUSINESS MODELS.
* WITH THE HELP OF CLOUD COMPUTING THE SPEED AND AGILITY IN MAKING RESOURCES IS AVAILABLE TO DEVELOPERS.
* AS IOT PRODUCESS A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA OR BIG DATA IT BECOME DEFFICULT FOR ENTERPRISES TO MANAGE THE FLOW AND STORAGE ALL THE DATA.
* THEREFORE CLOUD COMPUTING HELPS THE COMPANIES WITH ITS DIFFICULT MODEL AND IMPLEMENTATION PLATFORM TO MANAGE ALL THE TASK.
